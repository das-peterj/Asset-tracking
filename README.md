# Asset Tracking


This project is the start of an Asset Tracking database. It should have input possibilities from a user and print out
functionality of user data.


Asset Tracking is a way to keep track of the company assets, like Laptops, Stationary computers, Phones and so
on...


All assets have an end of life which for simplicity reasons is 3 years.
